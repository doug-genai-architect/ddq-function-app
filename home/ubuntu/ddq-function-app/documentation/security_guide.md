# Azure Function Security Guide: DDQ Chat Function

This guide outlines security considerations and best practices for the DDQ Chat Function Azure Function app.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

### 1.1. Function Access Control

The DDQ Chat Function is configured with `authLevel: "anonymous"` in the `function.json` file, meaning it can be accessed without an API key. This configuration was chosen based on the requirement for the function to be publicly accessible for integration with a custom GPT.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Public Exposure:** An anonymous function is accessible to anyone who knows the URL.
- **Rate Limiting:** By default, Azure Functions don't have built-in rate limiting, which could make the function vulnerable to abuse.

**Recommendations:**
- **IP Restrictions:** Consider adding IP restrictions if the custom GPT has a known, stable IP range.
- **API Management:** For production environments, consider placing the function behind Azure API Management to add rate limiting, throttling, and additional authentication layers.
- **Function Keys:** If the custom GPT can include authorization headers, consider changing `authLevel` to `"function"` and providing the function key to the custom GPT.

### 1.2. Azure Service Authentication

The function uses `DefaultAzureCredential` for authenticating with Azure OpenAI and Azure Blob Storage services.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Managed Identity:** This approach works best with a Managed Identity assigned to the Function App.
- **Credential Chain:** `DefaultAzureCredential` tries multiple authentication methods in sequence, which could potentially use unintended credentials if not properly configured.

**Recommendations:**
- **Assign Managed Identity:** Enable a System-assigned Managed Identity for the Function App.
- **Restrict RBAC Permissions:** Grant the Managed Identity only the specific permissions needed:
  - Azure OpenAI: "Cognitive Services User" role
  - Azure Blob Storage: "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role for the specific container
  - Azure AI Search: Use API key authentication as configured, but consider using RBAC if available

## 2. Data Protection

### 2.1. Data in Transit

**Security Considerations:**
- **HTTPS:** Azure Functions enforce HTTPS by default.
- **TLS Version:** Azure Functions use modern TLS protocols.

**Recommendations:**
- **Enforce TLS 1.2+:** Ensure minimum TLS version is set to 1.2 in the Function App configuration.
- **HTTPS Only:** Keep the default "HTTPS Only" setting enabled.

### 2.2. Data at Rest

**Security Considerations:**
- **Blob Storage:** Documents generated by the function are stored in Azure Blob Storage.
- **Application Settings:** Sensitive configuration values are stored in Application Settings.

**Recommendations:**
- **Enable Encryption:** Ensure Azure Storage encryption is enabled (default).
- **Access Control:** Implement appropriate access controls on the blob container.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Implement a data retention policy to automatically delete old documents after a defined period.
- **Customer-Managed Keys:** For higher security requirements, consider using customer-managed keys for storage encryption.

### 2.3. Sensitive Information

**Security Considerations:**
- **API Keys:** The function uses API keys for Azure AI Search.
- **Document Content:** The function processes potentially sensitive DDQ questions and generates documents with answers.

**Recommendations:**
- **Key Vault Integration:** Store API keys and secrets in Azure Key Vault and reference them in Application Settings.
- **Access Auditing:** Enable auditing on the blob container to track document access.
- **Content Scanning:** Consider implementing content scanning for sensitive information in generated documents.

## 3. Monitoring and Logging

### 3.1. Application Insights

**Security Considerations:**
- **Log Content:** Logs may contain sensitive information from user queries or document content.
- **Error Handling:** The function includes error handling that logs exceptions.

**Recommendations:**
- **Enable Application Insights:** Connect the Function App to Application Insights for comprehensive monitoring.
- **Log Sanitization:** Ensure logs don't contain full document content or sensitive user data.
- **Log Retention:** Configure appropriate log retention periods.
- **Alerts:** Set up alerts for suspicious activity patterns, such as high error rates or unusual traffic patterns.

### 3.2. Diagnostic Settings

**Recommendations:**
- **Enable Diagnostic Settings:** Configure diagnostic settings to capture function execution logs, platform logs, and metrics.
- **Log Analytics:** Send logs to Log Analytics for centralized monitoring and analysis.

## 4. Network Security

### 4.1. Virtual Network Integration

**Security Considerations:**
- **Public Endpoint:** By default, the function has a public endpoint accessible from the internet.

**Recommendations:**
- **VNet Integration:** For higher security environments, consider integrating the Function App with a Virtual Network.
- **Private Endpoints:** Consider using Private Endpoints for connections to Azure OpenAI, Blob Storage, and AI Search.
- **Service Endpoints:** Enable service endpoints to restrict traffic to specific Azure services.

### 4.2. Outbound IP Restrictions

**Recommendations:**
- **Restrict Outbound Traffic:** Configure the Function App to only allow outbound connections to required Azure services.
- **Network Security Groups:** If using VNet integration, implement NSGs to control traffic flow.

## 5. Custom GPT Integration Security

### 5.1. Request Validation

**Security Considerations:**
- **Input Validation:** The function validates that the request body contains a "prompt" field.
- **Custom GPT Origin:** There's no built-in validation that requests come from the intended custom GPT.

**Recommendations:**
- **Enhanced Validation:** Consider adding a shared secret or token that the custom GPT must include in requests.
- **Request Size Limits:** Implement limits on request size to prevent abuse.
- **Content Filtering:** Consider implementing content filtering to detect and block inappropriate queries.

### 5.2. Response Security

**Security Considerations:**
- **Document URLs:** The function returns URLs to generated documents in Azure Blob Storage.
- **Information Disclosure:** Error responses are sanitized to avoid exposing internal details.

**Recommendations:**
- **Time-Limited URLs:** Consider generating SAS tokens with short expiration times for document URLs.
- **Content Security Policy:** If the custom GPT displays content in a web context, implement appropriate CSP headers.

## 6. Compliance Considerations

Depending on your organization's requirements and the nature of the data being processed, consider:

- **Data Residency:** Ensure all Azure resources (Function App, OpenAI, Blob Storage, AI Search) are deployed in regions that meet data residency requirements.
- **Data Classification:** Implement appropriate data classification for the documents being processed.
- **Audit Trail:** Maintain an audit trail of all function invocations and document generations.
- **Privacy Impact Assessment:** Consider conducting a privacy impact assessment if processing personal data.

## 7. Security Testing

**Recommendations:**
- **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing of the function endpoint.
- **Code Review:** Perform security-focused code reviews before deployment.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud:** Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor for security recommendations and threats.

## 8. Incident Response

**Recommendations:**
- **Response Plan:** Develop an incident response plan specific to the function.
- **Contact Information:** Document contact information for security incidents.
- **Rollback Procedure:** Document procedures for rolling back to a known-good state in case of compromise.

By implementing these security measures, you can help protect the DDQ Chat Function and the data it processes while maintaining the required functionality for integration with the custom GPT.
